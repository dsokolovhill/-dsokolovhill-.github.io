  	<h3> A Quick History About Me and my Future</h3>
  	<p> My name is David N. Sokolov. I was born in Israel in 2003. I lived in Israel until I was ten years old. I had the experience of both living in an Israeli Settelment and a big city. My family moved to the United States when I was 10 years old and during my time in the USA, I  lived in Berkeley, CA and Portland, Or. At the moment, I am planning on entering the biological field. I am not positive in which specific sub field, but I am currently leaning closer to the medical field. I hope to live on the East Coast in the future, or Tel Aviv.
